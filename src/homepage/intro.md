Hello there! My name is Dylan Falconer and this is my website.

Here you will find interactive articles about programming and game development and devlogs for my WIP game.

I also make videos about programming, game development, etc. Check them out on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/DylanFalconer0) or [Odysee](https://odysee.com/@falconerd:d).
